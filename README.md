<b>Problem Statement: </b><br>
NYKS requires a software / Mobile through which we may take attendance of the Officers who are working in the different districts and States across the country.

<b>Solution proposed by us:</b><br>
We are planning to make an Android and iOS app using flutter and a website using HTML, CSS, JS which, when opened will prompt the user to login. If the user is new, he/she will have to register . During registration, the voice will also be recorded. All the details will be stored in database, for which we will use Firebase.
After successfully registering, the user will have to login themselves. During login, the user will also get OTP for safety and security.  After login, the user's location will be fetched. After fetching the current location of the user, if the user is in the premise of the office, he will be prompted to enter his voice (voice recognition). 
If it is successfully matched with the registered voice, the user's attendance will be recorded. Also, the user will have a record of their attendance.
